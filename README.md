# Recommender-System-using-Machine-Learning
## Similarity-based recommender systems

### Outline:

#### Introduction:
Explain the project goal and purpose.
Briefly introduce the libraries and tools that will be used.
#### Data Collection and Analysis:
Collect course-related datasets from various sources.
Analyze the data and preprocess it using Pandas library.
Calculate cosine similarity and create a similarity matrix.
#### Collaborative Filtering:
Implement non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and matrix factorization (MF) for collaborative filtering.
Use the KNN algorithm to generate recommendations.
Content-based Filtering:
Build similarity-based recommender systems using content-based filtering.
Use the TF-IDF algorithm to calculate the similarity between the courses.
#### Predictive Models:
Train a neural network model to predict course ratings.
Construct regression and classification models to predict course ratings based on various features.
#### Streamlit App:
Build a Streamlit app that displays the recommended courses based on user input.
Allow users to filter courses based on their preferences and interests.
#### Peer Evaluation:
Share the project with peers and receive feedback.
Evaluate and provide feedback on the work of peers.
#### Conclusion:
Summarize the project outcomes and achievements.
Discuss potential future improvements and enhancements to the recommender system.
